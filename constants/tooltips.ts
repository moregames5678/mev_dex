    "RDC Settings": "RPC is probably one of the most important things for your setup. There are a few things to consider here. location location can affect the performance in several different ways. First you want your server to be as close to your RPC as possible. The easiest way to test is ping your rpc address from your server. Example: Copy The ideal value for a good location is <10 ms. The most idea location is <1 ms, which basically means your RPC is physically located in the same data center as your server.",
    Bot: 'Soland flash loan charges a 0.04% fee based on the amount you borrow. So a trade that borrows 1000 USDC as shown above will need to find an opportunity that gives you at least 1000.4 USDC back for you to make a profit, compares to at least 1000 USDC when you are not using flash loans. This will result in more failed transactions if you send using spam, or less overall landing if used with Jito. The upside is you can get opportunities that is only possible with big amount. You can also use flash loan as a kick start option to minimize your risk of putting too much amount in your wallet.',

    'Pay Fee With Profit': "This will only affect SOL as base mint. When enabled, the bot will unwrap your profit before sending the jito tip/bot fee, which can be very useful if you don't leave much SOL balance in your wallet, or if you are targeting largest opportunities and afraid to not have enough SOL to pay for a big hit.",
